                        First of all I know I said i was gonna revamp the website of VK dudzele but i did not find a good api to get the data i needed easily.
                        Also, I'm not a designer so my try at the website didn't look that good. And if you are trying to remake a website it's supposed to become better.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-body">
                        So I made a little app to fidget with, I noticed that when i watch a movie or tv show I'm always fidgeting with something so that's why I made this.

                        I think the concept of a PWA is very cool but to be honest i don't really see why a consultant has to make A PWA themselves.
                        And i hope you like Star Wars or this would probably be annoying.

                        P.S. you can get bigger robots by swinging a lot with the robots.
