                        First of all I know I said i was gonna revamp the website of VK dudzele but there were a lot of other projects and I'm not a designer so my try at the website didn't look that good. So I (a consultant) focused on the project that I think are of greater importance to me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-body">
                        Also to be completely honest I have no clue what use this is for a consultant. I know you don't chose which courses we have to follow but still. But I do have to admit it's nice to know that it's possible but I don't see a use for it where a consultant has to create such a thing himself.

                        Thanks for reading what i think of the fact that we have to make a PWA ourselves. And i hope you like Star Wars or this would probably have been anoying.
                        So thanks for reading and see you next year(or in August..)
